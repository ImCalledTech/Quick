# About
GoogleOpen is a free, open source chrome extension designed to help users navigate around Google websites with ease

# Instructions for insall:
1. Click on 'Code' and then 'Dowload Zip'
2. Unzip the download zipped folder to an accessable folder, like 'C:\Users\usernamehere\Documents'. Do NOT unzip it into a new folder, unzip into an accessable subfolder
3. On your browser, locate your extensions. This can usually be done by opening a new tab and entering the following URL: 'edge://extensions'. If you are using chrome or another browser, replace 'edge' with your browser name (i.e. change it to 'chrome://extensions')
4. Next we will need to load in the extensions. Firstly, we must turn on Developer Mode. There should be a toggle switch which you can turn on labled 'Developer Mode'. Make sure to toggle the switch on. If it prompts you, click 'OK' or 'Continue'.
5. Almost there! Once you have turned on Developer Mode, three new buttons should appear. Click on 'Load unpacked' and a new window should pop up. Locate the subfolder where you extracted the zipped folder and select the folder named 'GoogleOpen-main'. Then click 'Select folder' on the window.
6. You're done! To use the extension, click on the google icon on the top bar (the extensions are located to the right of the address bar).
